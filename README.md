# Pitch Arena

### A Flask web application where users can post pitches, vote on them. A user can also leave feedback through comments once they are signed in.


## Description

In life your first impression matters a whole lot more than you would think. As humans we form impressions just 30 seconds after we interact with somebody. You need to be prepared to make a good first impression and that is why we created Pitch Arena. In Pitch Arena you can create pitches to make the most of that first impression. You get to see other users' pitches and get an idea and also, get feedback on your pitches.
